## Features
- **3D LiDAR Odometry:** Accurate motion estimation using MOLA's LiDAR odometry component.

- **Mapping:** Real-time 3D map generation of simulated environments.

- **Isaac Sim:** Utilization of NVIDIA Isaac Sim for realistic sensor data simulation.

- **ROS 2 Integration:** Seamless communication between simulation and MOLA components via ROS 2.

- **RViz2:** Powerful visualization tool in the ROS2 ecosystem, offering real-time rendering of robot states, -sensor data, maps, and navigation goals.
Facilitates debugging and system diagnostics with an intuitive GUI.
